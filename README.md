# Tic-Tac-Toe in Haskell, with minimax AI and Gloss GUI

Play against an AI that is unbeatable at tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses). Leveraging the minimax algorithm, the AI determines the best move at each turn, resulting in a game that always either ends in a draw, or with the AI beating the human player (you).
