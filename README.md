# Tic-Tac-Toe in Haskell, with minimax AI and Gloss GUI

Play against an AI that is unbeatable at tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses). Leveraging the minimax algorithm, the AI determines the best move at each turn, resulting in a game that always either ends in a draw, or with the AI beating the human player (you).

# How to Use

Download the folder tictactoe from this repository. If you have stack installed, cd into tictactoe in the terminal and run:

``` zsh
stack run
```
From here, you are player one, or 'X'. Pick a square and play tic-tac-toe against the AI. Can you win? No, mathematically impossible, if I have done my job right.
